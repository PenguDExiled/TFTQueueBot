Step 1:
Download the "main" folder (3rd folder from top) in github and the tesseract OCR (last file).
Execute the "tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-(...)" and go through installation. If possible - keep everything unchanged - in particular the installation folder.

Step 2:
Press "Windows Key" and search for "variable". Open the first suggestion from Windows. Press on the last option "environment variables".
Now search in the bottom box the variable "Path". Click on it and then click on "edit". Now click on "new" and type "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR".
If you changed the installation folder, you have to change this to what ever you changed the installation folder to.

Step 3:
Almost ready to go. Open the "main" folder you also downloaded. Search for the "main.exe". Right click and open it as admin. It won't work if you don't. 

Now a window should open. Everything else is explained there in detail. But you only have to enter a username and press "Run"

Thank you for reading.
